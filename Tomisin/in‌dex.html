        <p>Friendship...</p>
        <p>That's what it's all about</p>
        <p>A question waiting to be answered</p>
        <p>Different people asking all over</p>
        <p>What is friendship about?</p>
        <p>Cause quite frankly we've all friends</p>
        <p>Sorry, people who left when we needed them most</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>But Oluwatomisin...</p>
        <p>She's just one of a kind</p>
        <p>Over the past few months, I've learnt a lot</p>
        <p>First... A friend is not one who is always availabe</p>
        <p>A friend is one who drops evrything just to be there</p>
        <p>A friend is one who doesn't necessarily understand but is always ready to listen</p>
        <p>And no, she's not perfect but I'd pick her now and a million times again</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Tomisin...</p>
        <p>I learnt to be a friend from her</p>
        <p>I learnt to care from her</p>
        <p>I learnt to be me</p>
        <p>Have you ever felt so safe around someone?</p>
        <p>Cause that's how I feel when I talk to her</p>
        <p>I say nonsense everytime but she always listens like it all makes sense</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>And I...</p>
        <p>I feel like a burden</p>
        <p>But she somewhat makes the burden less</p>
        <p>I feel like a bad friend but all at the same time enough</p>
        <p>I feel like she'll get tired but at the same time I feel she doesn't want to</p>
        <p>But what do I love most... It's the way Tomisin is never fake</p>
        <p>She is just Tomisin. The last born that I love and care about</p>
        <p>Basically, this is my definition of friendship</p>
        <p>Tomisin, is my definition of friendship</p>
